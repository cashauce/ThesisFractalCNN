# Enhanced Compression Time Efficiency of Brain MRI Fractal Image Compression Using CNN-Guided and KD-Tree Optimized Encoding

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is our undergraduate thesis at **Batangas State University - The National Engineering University, Alangilan Campus**.  
It introduces a hybrid approach to medical image compression that combines **fractal image compression**, **convolutional neural networks (CNN)**, and **KD-tree optimization**.  

The goal is to **accelerate the compression process for brain MRI images** while maintaining high image quality, ensuring that medical data remains accurate for diagnosis and efficient for storage and transmission in hospital systems.

## 🚀 Features
- **CNN-Guided Encoding** – uses CNNs to assist in image partitioning and feature extraction.  
- **KD-Tree Optimization** – accelerates self-similarity search during encoding.  
- **High Image Quality** – preserves diagnostic integrity, evaluated through PSNR, SSIM, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score.  
- **Efficient Storage** – reduces MRI image size while ensuring accessibility in hospital data storage systems.
